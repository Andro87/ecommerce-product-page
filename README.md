## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   SCSS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project tested my knowledge of React and allowed me to learn about React Context and useContext() and practice it.
The most challenging aspects I worked on were :

-   how to structure the code to better use Context when necessary;
-   learn how to use the context as a component,
-   use Embla Carousel library to switch through images smoothly;

### Useful resources

-   [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) - A library that helped my to find a way to smoothly switch the image by clicking on the thumbnails images.

-   [React Context for beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/) - A useful resource to start learning about React Context.

-   [React Context and usecontext](https://dmitripavlutin.com/react-context-and-usecontext/#32-when-context-changes) - Another great resource that helped me to have a better understanding of React Context.
